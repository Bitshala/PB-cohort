# Programing Bitcoin - Study Cohort

A self-study cohort program organized on [Programming Bitcoin](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-bitcoin/9781492031482/).
It's an in-depth tutorial series using `bitcoin-cli` and `bitcoind` in `regtest` via the command-line. We'll be there to support you as you cover very basic to advanced
`bitcoin-cli` operations and learn with a community of enthusiastic people.

It's a comprehensive Bitcoin technical handbook, that also leaves the reader with a handmade python Bitcoin
utility library.

In short during the cohort, you go through the material from [Programing Bitcoin](https://github.com/jimmysong/programmingbitcoin)
each week as detailed in [Cohort Structure and Timeline](#cohort-structure-and-timeline) and meet every week to discuss the material and any questions you might have.
You'll also get exercise questions to help you understand the content better.

## About
Programming Bitcoin is a comprehensive technical handbook that teaches you how to use Bitcoin Core through the command line. The series covers all the
essential Bitcoin operations that can be performed using the bitcoin-cli and a local bitcoind regtest node. Starting from basic transaction construction to advanced scripting,
this tutorial is a must-read for aspiring Bitcoin developers.

Upon successful completion of the cohort program, participants will receive a certificate recognizing their proof-of-work.

Programming Bitcoin is a comprehensive Bitcoin technical handbook that covers all the basic building blocks of Bitcoin engineering, via hands on python code as exercise, after each chapters.

A Complete follow-though of this will leave any experienced developer to quickly get started on building on Bitcoin Layer 1. They can either follow python, or choose a library in their own preferred language.

The Program will consists of
- Weekly chapter assignments from the book.
- Weekly assignment questions for each participants.
- End of week exercise completion target of the weekly chapters.

## Prerequisites
Participants are expected to have a basic knowledge of Bitcoin. Prior to joining the cohort, it is recommended to cover the material in the book [Mastering Bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook).

Basic python skill assumed. Brush up via this [youtube]().

## Cohort Overview
The cohort program will comprehensively cover chapters 1 to 14 of [Programing Bitcoin](https://github.com/jimmysong/programmingbitcoin).

Cohort mode is **self-study**. Participants are expected to find committed weekly reading time, proactive in asking questions, exploring more literatures on open web, prepare their assigned questions and explain to peers in weekly study groups, complete and post exercises consistently by end of week.

After the cohort, participants are encouraged to stick around the discord channel and keep following up on their
possible paths. Make friends, share ideas, start group side projects.
